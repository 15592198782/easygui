Introduction:
-------------

These instructions explain how to actually deploy easygui

Building the documentation
--------------------------

To generate sphinx docs:
- go into the sphinx directory
- type make html

This will build the documentation and place it in the documentation directory.

File structure of website:

This repository contains both up-to-date materials as well as older releases.
When uploading files to a website, upload 'documentation' and
'legacy_website'.  Put both of the contents in the top-level directory.
'legacy_website' is not directly accessable but the new documentation does
have a link to ./sourceforge_site_as_of_2014_11_21/index.html

Creating a package
------------------
* Update README.md and README.txt to include the current release note text
* Update sourceforge website with 'documentation' and historic site (as described above)
