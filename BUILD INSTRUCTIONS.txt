NOTE: As of 0.97, documentation has been migrated to reStructured/Sphinx.

Generally, this structure ships as-is.

Documentation is manually generated.

To generate sphinx docs:
- go into the main sphinx directory
- type make html
- copy the _build/html entire directory into the documentation directory
