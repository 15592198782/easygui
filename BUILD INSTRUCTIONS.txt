Introduction:
-------------

These instructions explain how to actually deploy easygui

Building the documentation
--------------------------

To generate sphinx docs:
- go into the sphinx directory
- type make clean.  You will see errors.  This step removes stagnent html
  files.
- type make html

This will build the documentation and place it in the documentation directory.

File structure of website:

This repository contains both up-to-date materials as well as older releases.
When uploading files to a website, upload 'documentation' and
'legacy_website'.  Put both of the contents in the top-level directory.
'legacy_website' is not directly accessable but the new documentation does
have a link to ./sourceforge_site_as_of_2014_11_21/index.html
*NOTE: For obvious reasons :), you likely will never need to re-upload the legacy_website.

Creating a package
------------------
* Update README.md and README.txt to include the current release note text
* Update sphinx/conf.py with new version and release date
* Update easygui/easygui.py with new version in eg_version.  This should be fixed.
* Update sourceforge website with 'documentation' directory
	sftp: web.sourceforge.net
	user: robertlugg (for example)
	password: your sourceforge password
* Update Github website: You can now host documentation at http://pythonhosted.org/easygui. To upload documentation, prepare a .zip file that is unpacked into this URL. Only static pages are supported. The zip file must have a top-level "index.html".
* Upload to Github
