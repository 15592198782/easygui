easygui for Students
--------------------
Austrian elementary-school teacher `Horst Jens <http://members.chello.at/horst.jens/>`_ says:

  "I can proudly report that EasyGui is very popular with my students (game programming courses)."

Horst and his students have made several videos showing their use of EasyGui:

  - `Lexi shows msgbox <http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=pythonJensFromKids2&fromSeriesID=57>`_
  - `Leo shows buttonbox <http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=pythonJensFromKids3&fromSeriesID=57>`_
  - `Mira and Teresa show a simple graphic adventure game <http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/video?name=8200010&fromSeriesID=820>`_

.. The following quote is from the original website, however, the link
   is broken.
   In August 2009 the University of Toronto announced that it would be using EasyGui while using Python as a first-year programming language:
   "We've dropped Tkinter this fall in favour of EasyGUI, which has major limitations but is much more teachable."
 
   Their experiences are described `here <http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/2834.html>`_
