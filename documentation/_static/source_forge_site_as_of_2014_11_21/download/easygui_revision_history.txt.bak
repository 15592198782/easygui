ENHANCEMENTS
------------------------------------------------------
 * Previous versions of EasyGui could display only .gif image files using the
   msgbox "image" argument. This version can now display all image-file formats
   supported by PIL the Python Imaging Library) if PIL is installed.
   If msgbox is asked to open a non-gif image file, it attempts to import
   PIL and to use PIL to convert the image file to a displayable format.
   If PIL cannot be imported (probably because PIL is not installed)
   EasyGui displays an error message saying that PIL must be installed in order
   to display the image file.

   Note that
   http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
   says that PIL doesn't yet support Python 3.x.

ENHANCEMENTS
------------------------------------------------------
 * The codebox and textbox functions now return the contents of the box, rather
   than simply the name of the button ("Yes").  This makes it possible to use
   codebox and textbox as data-entry widgets.  A big "thank you!" to Dominic
   Comtois for requesting this feature, patiently explaining his requirement,
   and helping to discover the tkinter techniques to implement it.

   NOTE THAT in theory this change breaks backward compatibility.  But because
   (in previous versions of EasyGui) the value returned by codebox and textbox
   was meaningless, no application should have been checking it.  So in actual
   practice, this change should not break backward compatibility.

 * Added support for SPACEBAR to command buttons.  Now, when keyboard
   focus is on a command button, a press of the SPACEBAR will act like
   a press of the ENTER key; it will activate the command button.

 * Added support for keyboard navigation with the arrow keys (up,down,left,right)
   to the fields and buttons in enterbox, multenterbox and multpasswordbox,
   and to the buttons in choicebox and all buttonboxes.

 * added highlightthickness=2 to entry fields in multenterbox and
   multpasswordbox.  Now it is easier to tell which entry field has
   keyboard focus.


BUG FIXES
------------------------------------------------------
 * In EgStore, the pickle file is now opened with "rb" and "wb" rather than
   with "r" and "w".  This change is necessary for compatibility with Python 3+.
   Thanks to Marshall Mattingly for reporting this problem and providing the fix.

 * In integerbox, the actual argument names did not match the names described
   in the docstring. Thanks to Daniel Zingaro of at University of Toronto for
   reporting this problem.

 * In integerbox, the "argLowerBound" and "argUpperBound" arguments have been
   renamed to "lowerbound" and "upperbound" and the docstring has been corrected.

   NOTE THAT THIS CHANGE TO THE ARGUMENT-NAMES BREAKS BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY.
   If argLowerBound or argUpperBound are used, an AssertionError with an
   explanatory error message is raised.

 * In choicebox, the signature to choicebox incorrectly showed choicebox as
   accepting a "buttons" argument.  The signature has been fixed.

 * Added EgStore class to to provide basic easy-to-use persistence.

BUG FIXES

   a textbox and a codebox.  This was not a problem for Windows users.
