EasyGui version 0.96 has been released. 

It can be downloaded from the <a href="http://easygui.sourceforge.net/download/current_version">downloads page</a> of the EasyGui page at SourceForge.

This version of EasyGui fixes some problems with Python-version independence.

BUG FIXES
------------------------------------------------------
 * A statement with Python 2.x-style exception-handling syntax raised
   a syntax error when running under Python 3.x.
   Thanks to David Williams for reporting this problem.

 * Under some circumstances, PIL was unable to display non-gif images
   that it should have been able to display.
   The cause appears to be non-version-independent import syntax.
   PIL modules are now imported with a version-independent syntax.
   Thanks to Horst Jens for reporting this problem.
