An FAQ consisting of one question.  Help please :)

#. Can I specify a custom sort order for the items in a choicebox?

   No, there is no way to specify a custom order. The reason is that
   the data must be sorted in order for the "jump to" feature
   (namely, to jump down in the list by pressing keyboard keys) to work.

   For some tips on how to control the order of items in a choicebox,
   see this recipe from the Easygui Cookbook.
